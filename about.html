<h2>About</h2>

<p>Ye wants t’ know more about th' ole cap’n, eh? Well, me hearties, dead men tell no tales. Savvy…? An’ as fer this here blog, let’s jus’ say it’s about that hallowed day o’ 31 October where th' lost souls in Davy Jones’ locker rise from thar watery grave ‘n come out t’ play under th' light o’ the moon. Shiver me timbers! It brings goosebumps t’ me barnacle-covered bones jus’ thinkin’ about it... Halloween Ahoy!</p>
