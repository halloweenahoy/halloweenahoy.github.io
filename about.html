An’ as fer this here blog, let’s jus’ say it’s about that hallowed day o’ 31 October where the lost souls in Davy Jones’ locker rise from thar watery grave ‘n come out t’ play under the light o’ the moon. Shiver me timbers! It brings goosebumps t’ me barnacle-covered bones jus’ thinkin’ about it... Trick arrr treat!</p>
